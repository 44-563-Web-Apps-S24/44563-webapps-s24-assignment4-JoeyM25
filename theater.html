        <p>
            <h5>YASHA.</h5> The common people have come to say good-bye. I am of the
            opinion, Ermolai Alexeyevitch, that they're good people, but they don't
            understand very much.
        </p>

        <p>
            [The voices die away. LUBOV ANDREYEVNA and GAEV enter. She is not crying
            but is pale, and her face trembles; she can hardly speak.]
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>GAEV.</h5> You gave them your purse, Luba. You can't go on like that, you
            can't!
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h5>LUBOV.</h5> I couldn't help myself, I couldn't! [They go out.]
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h5>LOPAKHIN.</h5> [In the doorway, calling after them] Please, I ask you most
            humbly! Just a little glass to say good-bye. I didn't remember to bring
            any from town and I only found one bottle at the station. Please, do!
            [Pause] Won't you really have any? [Goes away from the door] If I only
            knew--I wouldn't have bought any. Well, I shan't drink any either.
            [YASHA carefully puts the tray on a chair] You have a drink, Yasha, at
            any rate.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h5>YASHA.</h5> To those departing! And good luck to those who stay behind!
            [Drinks] I can assure you that this isn't real champagne.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h5>LOPAKHIN.</h5> Eight roubles a bottle. [Pause] It's devilish cold here.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            <h5>YASHA.</h5> There are no fires to-day, we're going away. [Laughs]
        </p>

        <p>
            <h5>LOPAKHIN.</h5> What's the matter with you?
