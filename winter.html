            It's October outside, but it's as sunny and as quiet as if
            it were summer. Good for building. [Looking at his watch and speaking
            through the door] Ladies and gentlemen, please remember that it's only
            forty-seven minutes till the train goes! You must go off to the station
            in twenty minutes. Hurry up.

            I think it's time we went. The carriages are waiting. Where
            the devil are my goloshes? They're lost. [Through the door] Anya, I
            can't find my goloshes! I can't!
